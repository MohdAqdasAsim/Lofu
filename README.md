Got it, MoonKnight — *StudyRoom* sounds dope and totally achievable in 24 hours! Let’s flesh this out MVP-style so you can hit the ground running.

## ⚡ StudyRoom – MVP Breakdown

### 🎯 **Core Idea**
> *A single-page web app where I can grind in peace — private, themed virtual study rooms with chill Lo-Fi and a personal task checklist.*

---

## ✅ **What to Build in 24 Hours (MVP)**

### 💻 Page Sections:
1. **Header / Room Title**
   - Editable name: e.g. “MoonKnight’s Midnight Lab”
   - Maybe a tiny quote like: _“Focus, flow, finish.”_

2. **🎵 Lo-Fi Player**
   - Embed a Lo-Fi YouTube stream or use an audio loop.
   - Autoplays (with user interaction due to browser rules).
   - Option to toggle sound on/off.

3. **📝 Task Checklist**
   - Add/remove tasks.
   - Check things off (with satisfying animation or strikethrough).
   - Save to `localStorage` so it persists across sessions.

4. **🎨 Theme Picker (Optional, but adds big vibe points)**
   - Choose between 2-3 themes: e.g., “Night Mode”, “Cafe Light”, “Retro Green”
   - Changes background gradient, font, maybe ambient sounds.

## 🧱 **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS
- **State Management:** useState + localStorage
- **Music:** Embed YouTube Lo-Fi or royalty-free background audio loop
- **Deployment:** Vercel or Netlify (one-click and fast)

---

## 🌈 UI / Vibes

- **Design:** Minimalist, cozy, clean.
- **Color palette:** Muted tones with contrast depending on theme.
- **Fonts:** Use a soft rounded font for titles and monospaced font for checklist (feels more “focus-y”)
- **Extras (if time):**
   - Subtle floating particle or wave animation in background
   - “Focus Timer” — basic countdown (Pomodoro style)
